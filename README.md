# CNP working group P meta-analysis

Repository containing data and scripts needed to investigate P fertilization impacts on leaf and whole-plant functional traits.

Folder contents:
 - `data`                                  = contains compiled meta-analysis dataset and MESI dataset
 - `data_summaries`                        = contains data summaries of all raw data. Data summaries include means, standard deviations, and standard errors of all treatments in a given experiment
 - `helper_fxns`                           = contains functions that aid in meta-analysis
 - `plots`                                 = contains relevant plots from meta-analysis results
 - `raw_data`                              = contains all raw datasheets from studies to be added in meta-analysis
 - `scripts`                               = contains all scripts for summarizing study data, conducting the meta-analysis, and producing relevant figures
 - `lit_search_np_fert_exps.xlsx`          = spreadsheet that lists all possible P fertilization experiments that were at one point considered for the meta-analysis
 - `np_fert_exps_in_meta_analysis.xlsx`    = spreadsheet that lists all studies included in the meta-analysis
